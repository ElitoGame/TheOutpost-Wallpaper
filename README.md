# TheOutpost Wallpaper

A custom Lively web wallpaper. I rendered the office room in Blender for a Uni project and decided to use it as my wallpaper. The background Screenshot is taken from the game Satisfactory, but I plan on replacing it with custom landscapes once I get some time to work with UE5.

The background has a Audio visualizer and system usage information. The tricky part about those is that they are not flat images. They've been rotated to fit the image perspective. The Background is designed for a 2560x1440 screen, however, it should support any 16:9 screen monitor. Sorry Widescreen users...

## TODO:

- [ ] Animated backgrounds

- [ ] Time based Background
- [ ] Additional Customization options especially for the Hologram
- [ ] Check to see if there's a way to improve startup performance.
- [ ] User customizable Backgrounds
